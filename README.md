![thepower education_15750_Sign_about_Barcelona_and_Budapest_bo_211d3b8d-22c6-4894-b653-a2f6e1dd63bb_2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08fd14b5-b61a-4e1c-af3a-5914b0c397d7)

This project focuses on using advanced technologies to provide an exceptional **travel experience** to our clients. We focus on lonely people that need a great experience on Christmas.

We combine data on transportation, accommodation, and local activities to help our clients plan their perfect vacation based on information about tourist destinations. We use a combination of **APIs** and **Web Scraping** techniques to obtain real-time information from various providers.

The main goal is to help our clients enjoy their vacation to the fullest, offering **personalized recommendations based on data**. We have selected **Budapest** and **Barcelona** for testing, where a detailed study of available flights from **Madrid**, accommodations, and activities is conducted.

### Key areas of analysis:

**Flights, Accommodation, and Activities**: Collect information about flight frequency, schedules, accommodation prices, and available activities to optimize travel recommendations and provide the best possible experience to clients.

**Use of APIs and Web Scraping**: Various tools were used for this project. We employed the **Google Flights API** through **SerpApi** to obtain detailed and accurate information about available flights. Additionally, scraping techniques were performed on sites like **Booking.com** and **Civitatis.com** to collect information about accommodations and local activities, overcoming possible limitations in API availability.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Use exploratory analysis to understand which destinations and options best suit the needs of our clients.

## 🔧 Installation and Requirements

This project was developed using **Python 3.12**. To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

### Additional Requirements
- **[SerpApi](https://serpapi.com/)**: To efficiently access the Google Flights API and obtain flight data.

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SupernovaIa/Proyecto3-Explorando-Viajes
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
   cd Proyecto3-Explorando-Viajes
```

### 3. Install the required libraries:
The following libraries are required for this project:

- **[Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/getting_started/install_and_run/)** (v4.21.0)
- **[Beautiful Soup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installing-beautiful-soup)** (v4.12.3)

## 📊 Results and Conclusions

The data analysis provided the following insights:

- **Flight Availability**: Certain limitations were found in the frequency of flights to some selected destinations, especially during certain times of the year. This is crucial for travel planning.
- **Accommodation Prices and Services**: The collected data shows that accommodation availability and prices vary significantly between high and low seasons. Some destinations have a clear oversupply during specific months, which can be leveraged to offer discounts.
- **Local Activities**: The most popular activities include gastronomic tourism and adventure sports. Additionally, sustainability and eco-conscious experiences are particularly attractive to certain segments of clients, such as solo travelers seeking sustainable alternatives.
- **Temporal Patterns**: Seasonal trends were identified for flights and accommodations, with peaks during holiday months and summer.

## 🔄 Next Steps:
- **In-Depth Destination Analysis**: Conduct a detailed analysis of destinations with greater price and availability variability, as well as improve personalization of recommendations for different types of clients.
- **Experience Improvement**: Implement a predictive model to recommend the best time to book flights and accommodation based on collected data.
- **Sustainability**: Explore more options for sustainable activities to meet the needs of eco-conscious clients.
